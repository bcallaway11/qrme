\title{qrme: Quantile regression with measurement error}
\usage{
qrme(formla, tau = 0.5, data, nmix = 3, startbet = NULL,
  startmu = NULL, startsig = NULL, startpi = NULL, tol = 1,
  cl = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{formla}{y ~ x}

\item{tau}{vector for which quantiles to compute quantile regression}

\item{data}{a data.frame that contains y and x}

\item{nmix}{The number of mixture components of the measurement error}

\item{startbet}{an LxK matrix of starting values for beta where
L is the dimension of tau and K is the number of covariates (default is
NULL and in this case, the starting values are set to be the QR
coefficients coming from QR that ignores measurment error)}

\item{startmu}{A vector of length nmix of starting values for the mean
of the mixture of normals distribution for the measurment error (default
is NULL and in this case, the starting values are basically set to be
equally spaced from -nmix to nmix but forced to have mean 0)}

\item{startsig}{A vector of length nmix of starting values for the
standard deviation of the mixture of normals distribution for the
measurement error (default is NULL and in this case, the starting values
are all set to be 1)}

\item{startpi}{A vector of length nmix of starting values for the fraction
of observations in each component of the mimxture of normals distribution
for the measurement error (default is NULL and in this case, the starting
values are all set to be 1/nmix)}

\item{tol}{This is the convergence criteria.  When the change in the
Euclidean distance between the new parameters (at each iteration) and
the old parameters (from the previous iteration) is smaller than tol,
the algorithm concludes.  In general, larger values for tol will result
in a fewer number of iterations and smaller values will result in more
accurate estimates.}

\item{cl}{The numbe of clusters to use for parallel computation (default
is 1 so that computation is not done in parallel)}
}
\value{
an object of class "merr"
}
\description{
Quantile Regression with measurement error in the dependent
 variable using an EM-algorithm.  In practice, this function assumes
 that the measurement error distribution is a mixture of normal
 distributions.
