\arguments{
\item{formla}{y ~ x}

\item{tau}{vector for which quantiles to compute quantile regression}

\item{data}{a data.frame that contains y and x}

\item{nmix}{The number of mixture components of the measurement error}

\item{startbet}{an LxK matrix of starting values for beta where
L is the dimension of tau and K is the number of covariates (default is
NULL and in this case, the starting values are set to be the QR
coefficients coming from QR that ignores measurment error)}

\item{startmu}{A vector of length nmix of starting values for the mean
of the mixture of normals distribution for the measurment error (default
is NULL and in this case, the starting values are basically set to be
equally spaced from -nmix to nmix but forced to have mean 0)}

\item{startsig}{A vector of length nmix of starting values for the
standard deviation of the mixture of normals distribution for the
measurement error (default is NULL and in this case, the starting values
are all set to be 1)}

\item{startpi}{A vector of length nmix of starting values for the fraction
of observations in each component of the mimxture of normals distribution
for the measurement error (default is NULL and in this case, the starting
values are all set to be 1/nmix)}

\item{simstep}{The type of simulation step to use in the EM algorithm.
The default is "MH" for Metropolis-Hasting.  The alternative is
"ImpSamp" for importance sampling.}

\item{tol}{This is the convergence criteria.  When the change in the
Euclidean distance between the new parameters (at each iteration) and
the old parameters (from the previous iteration) is smaller than tol,
the algorithm concludes.  In general, larger values for tol will result
in a fewer number of iterations and smaller values will result in more
accurate estimates.}

\item{iters}{How many iterations to use in the simulation step (default is
400)}

\item{burnin}{How many iterations to drop in the simulation step (default
is 200)}

\item{drawsd}{The starting standard deviation for the measurement error
term.}

\item{cl}{The numbe of clusters to use for parallel computation (default
is 1 so that computation is not done in parallel)}

\item{se}{Whether or not to compute standard errors using the bootstrap
(default is FALSE)}

\item{biters}{Number of bootstrap iterations to use.  Only is considered
in the case where computing standard errors (default is 100)}

\item{messages}{Whether or not to report details of estimation procedure
(default is FALSE)}

\description{
Quantile Regression with measurement error in the dependent
 variable using an EM-algorithm.  In practice, this function assumes
 that the measurement error distribution is a mixture of normal
 distributions.
