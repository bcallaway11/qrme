\usage{
fy.x(y, betmat, XX, tau)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{particular value of y to estimate f(y|x)}

\item{betmat}{LxK matrix of parameter values with L the number of quantiles
and K the dimension of the covariates}

\item{XX}{An nxK matrix with n the number of observations of X}

\item{tau}{an L-vector containing the quantile at which Q(Y|X) was estimated}
}
\value{
An nx1 vector that contains f(y|X)
}
\description{
return the density of Y (for particular value y) conditional
 on X (which can include n observations) when Q(Y|X) has been estimated
 using QR.  This is used in our simulation approach.
