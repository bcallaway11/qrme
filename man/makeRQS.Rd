\description{
Take the results of the optimization and convert them
 into a quantile regression object, so we can use all the tools from
 the quantreg package (e.g. inverting the quantiles).  The key step
 here is rearrangement, because the objective function doesn't impose
 any ordering -- see the discussion in HLLP.  We follow HLLP's
 recommendation and order the QR parameters by what makes the quantiles
 to be increasing for the mean values of the x's.  This means that
 for any particular value of the x's, the quantile function may not
 necessarily be increasing in tau.  However, we can separately rearrange
 those as needed.  But this gives a way to report the QR parameters.
