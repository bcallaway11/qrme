\usage{
computeFytXC(yvals, tvals, Qyxpreds, Ftxpreds, tau, copula, copParam)
}
\arguments{
\item{yvals}{values to compute conditional distribution for}

\item{tvals}{values of treatment to compute conditional distribution for}

\item{Qyxpreds}{matrix of quantile regression predictions}

\item{Ftxpreds}{matrix of conditional distribution (T conditional on X)
predictions}

\item{tau}{values at which QR's were estimated}

\item{copula}{which type of copula was estimated (currently ignored and
imposes that the copula is Gumbel}

\item{copParam}{previously estimated copula parameter}
}
\value{
cube corresponding to conditional distribution as a function
 of y, t, and each row of X in the data
}
\description{
convert first step quantile regression estimates and second step copula
estimates into the distribution of Y conditional on T and X
this is not currently used (we replaced this numerical approach with
a direct calculation inside the R code).  This also only works currently
for a Gumbel copula.
