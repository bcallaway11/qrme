}
\arguments{
\item{startval}{The first value in the markov chain}

\item{iters}{The total number of measurement error draws to make}

\item{burnin}{The number of draws to drop}

\item{drawsd}{Trial values are drawn from N(0, sd=drawsd), default is 4}

\item{betmat}{LxK matrix of parameter values with L the number of quantiles
and K the dimension of the covariates}

\item{m}{The dimension of the measurement error}

\item{pi}{The probability of each mixture component (should have length
equal to m)}

\item{mu}{The mean of each mixture component (should have length equal
to m)}

\item{sig}{The standard deviation of each mixture component (should have
length equal to m)}

\item{y}{particular value of y}

\item{x}{particular value of x}

\item{tau}{an L-vector of all the quantiles where betas were estimated}
