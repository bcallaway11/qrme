\title{Inner part of EM-algorithm for QR with measurement error}
\usage{
em.algo.inner(formla, data, betmat, tau, m = 1, pi = 1, mu = 0,
  sig = 1, cl = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{betmat}{LxK matrix of parameter values with L the number of quantiles
and K the dimension of the covariates}

\item{tau}{An L-vector indicating which quantiles have been estimated}

\item{m}{The number of components of the mixture distribution for the
measurement error}

\item{pi}{The probability of each mixture component (should have length
equal to m)}

\item{mu}{The mean of each mixture component (should have length equal
to m)}

\item{sig}{The standard deviation of each mixture component (should have
length equal to m)}
}
\value{
A list of QR parameters and parameters for mixture of normals for
 the measurement error term
}
\description{
Does the heavy-lifting of the EM-algorithm for QR with
 measurment error
