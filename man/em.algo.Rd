\usage{
em.algo(betmatguess, k = 1, piguess = 1, muguess = 0, sigguess = 1,
  tol = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{betmatguess}{Initial values for the beta parameters.  This should be
an LxK matrix where L is the number of quantiles and K is the dimension
of the covariates}

\item{k}{The number of components of the mixture distribution for the
measurement error}

\item{piguess}{Starting value for the probabilities of each mixture distribution (should have length equal to k)}

\item{muguess}{Starting value for the mean of each mixture component (should
have length equal to k)}

\item{sigguess}{Starting value for the standard deviation of each mixture
component (should have length equal to k)}

\item{tol}{This is the convergence criteria.  When the change in the
Euclidean distance between the new parameters (at each iteration) and
the old parameters (from the previous iteration) is smaller than tol,
the algorithm concludes.  In general, larger values for tol will result
in a fewer number of iterations and smaller values will result in more
accurate estimates.}
