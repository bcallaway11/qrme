\usage{
fv.yx(v, betmat, m, pi, mu, sig, Y, X, tau)
}
\arguments{
\item{v}{A particular value of the measurement error to estimate f(v|y,x)}

\item{betmat}{LxK matrix of parameter values with L the number of quantiles
and K the dimension of the covariates}

\item{m}{The dimension of the measurement error}

\item{pi}{The probability of each mixture component (should have length
equal to m)}

\item{mu}{The mean of each mixture component (should have length equal
to m)}

\item{sig}{The standard deviation of each mixture component (should have
length equal to m)}

\item{Y}{An nx1 vector of outcomes}

\item{X}{An nxK matrix of covariates}

\item{tau}{an L-vector of all the quantiles where betas were estimated}
}
\value{
n x 1 vector of f(v|Y,X)
}
\description{
Return the density of the measurement error conditional
 on y and x; this takes as given some QR parameters from Y* (the true
 outcome) conditional on X.  Here, we also presume that the distribution
 of the measurement error is a mixture of normal distributions
