\usage{
tmat(Y, T, qcutoffs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{vector of outcomes}

\item{T}{vector of treatments}

\item{qcutoffs}{the quantiles where to draw the cutoff points in the transition matrix; default is at the quartiles}
}
\value{
A matrix containing values of the transition matrix.  The columns contain different groups by value of the treatment,
 the rows contain different values for the outcome (it is ordered from bottom to top though as is standard for a transition matrix)
}
\description{
A function for computing transition matrices
}
