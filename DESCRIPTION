Description: Code for estimating quantile regressions with measurement error.  The first main set of functions estimates quantile regression with measurement error in the dependent variable using an EM-type-algorithm.  The second set of functions estimates quantile regressions with measurement error in the outcome and in a continuous "treatment" variable.  All functions allow for an arbitrary number of other covariates that are assumed not to be measured with error.
