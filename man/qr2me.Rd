\title{QR with 2-sided measurement error}
\usage{
qr2me(
  yname,
  tname,
  xformla,
  tau,
  data,
  xdf = NULL,
  tvals = NULL,
  copula = "gaussian",
  Qyx,
  Qtx,
  retFytxlist = FALSE,
  ndraws = 100,
  messages = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{yname}{name of the outcome in the passed in data}

\item{tname}{name of the treatment in the passed in data}

\item{xformla}{a one-sided formula for additional covariates (assumed
not to be measured with error)}

\item{tau}{a vector containing particular quantiles that have been estimated ??}

\item{data}{a data.frame containing the data used for estimation}

\item{xdf}{If you want conditional distributions to be returned, pass in the value of the distribution here;
otherwise the default behavior is to return a single distribution that averages over all values of X in the dataset}

\item{tvals}{values of the treatment to compute conditional distribution-type
parameters for}

\item{copula}{which type of copula to use (default is "gaussian")}

\item{Qyx}{quantile regression estimates (can be adjusted for measurement
error) of Y on X}

\item{Qtx}{quantile regression estimates (can be adjusted for measurement
error) of T on X}

\item{retFytxlist}{whether or not to return the conditional distribution
for every value of x in xdf
(default is FALSE because this can take up a lot of room in memory)}

\item{ndraws}{number of draws to use in MH algorithm to estimate first
step quantile regressions (default 250)}

\item{messages}{whether or not to report details of computation as they
occur (default is \code{FALSE})}
}

 in the outcome and measurement error in a particular continuous "treatment"
 variable.
